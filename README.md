RGBLED Android APP together with an Arduino - Bluetooth modul - RGB LED strip
======

My first Android App - it's an app to control a RGB LED strip via Smartphone. 


#3 Functionality
1. There are several buttons on the View. 
⋅⋅⋅one for the colors red, green, blue
⋅⋅* one for the color white
⋅⋅* 3 buttons for the brightness ( dark, regular, bright )
⋅⋅* and some more buttons for other chosen colors - for instance orange
2. The Bluetooth will be activated when the user starts the app. ( onStart )
3. You can connect to the Bluetooth modul on the Arduino by pressing the "connect" button. Make sure that you have selected the correct MAC address because there is currently no input field. It's hard coded!


If you want the Arduino Code or the  circuit configuration you can leave a comment.

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
