RGBLED Android APP together with an Arduino - Bluetooth modul - RGB LED strip
======

My first Android App - it's an app to control a RGB LED strip via Smartphone. 


#3 Functionality
- There are several buttons on the View. 
one for the colors red, green, blue
one for the color white
3 buttons for the brightness ( dark, regular, bright )
and some more buttons for other chosen colors - for instance orange
- The Bluetooth will be activated when the user starts the app. ( onStart )
- You can connect to the Bluetooth modul on the Arduino by pressing the "connect" button. Make sure that you have selected the correct MAC address because there is currently no input field. It's hard coded!


If you want the Arduino Code or the  circuit configuration you can leave a comment.
